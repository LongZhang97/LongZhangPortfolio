This portfolio consists of 5 projects. Specifically, 

**[Project1]** used multiple feature-selection-based linear regression models and tree-based regression models to **predict house prices**. One file is the [final report]([Project1.2]PredictingHousePrices_Report.pdf) and the other one is the [presentation slides]([Project1.1]PredictingHousePrices_Slides.pdf).

**[Project2]** used 5 linear classification models and 7 non-linear classification models to **predict whether an insurance claim is fraud or not**. One file is the [final report]([Project2.2]AutoInsuranceFraudClaimsDetection_Report.pdf) and the other one is the [presentation slides]([Project2.1]AutoInsuranceFraudClaimsDetection_Slides.pdf).

**[Project3]** used multiple linear regression, KNN, single-hidden-layer neural network, averaged neural network, regression tree, and random forest models to **predict airbnb prices**. One file is the [final report]([Project3.2]AirbnbPredictionReport.pdf) and the other one is the [presentation slides]([Project3.1]AirbnbPredictionSlides.pdf).

**[Project4]** used linear regression and single-hidden-layer neural network to **predict a user's viewport trajectory when watching a 360 video**, given different conditions, including whether use gaze data, different durations of prediction window and history window, and latitude position prediction or longitude position prediction. The [final result]([Project4.2]ViewportPrediction.png) is visualized in the .png file and the [detailed introduction]([Project4.1]ViewportPredictionCode.ipynb) is included in the .ipynb file.

**[Project5]** is a **[Micromap visualization project]([Project5]LinkedMicromapVisualization.pdf)**.
