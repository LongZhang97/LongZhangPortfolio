This repository consists of 5 projects. Specifically, 

**[Project1]** used multiple feature-selection-based linear regression models and tree-based regression models to **predict house prices**. One file is the [final report]([Project1.2]PredictingHousePrices_Report.pdf) and the other one is the presentation slides.

**[Project2]** used 5 linear classification models and 7 non-linear classification models to **predict whether an insurance claim is fraud or not**. One file is the final report and the other one is the presentation slides.

**[Project3]** used multiple linear regression, KNN, single-hidden-layer neural network, averaged neural network, regression tree, and random forest models to **predict airbnb prices**. One file is the final report and the other one is the presentation slides.

**[Project4]** used linear regression and single-hidden-layer neural network to **predict a user's viewport trajectory when watching a 360 video**, given different conditions, including whether use gaze data, different durations of prediction window and history window, and latitude position prediction or longitude position prediction. The final result is visualized in the .png file and the detailed introduction is included in the .ipynb file.

**[Project5]** is a **Micromap visualization project**.
